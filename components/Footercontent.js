               <h1>What is web hosting?</h1>
               <p>
Your website is hosted when a hosting service provider allocates space on its web server for your website's files( which are necessary content and codes that compose your site) to be stored. The files that make up a website are made available for viewing online through web hosting. Every website that you visit on the internet is hosted on the server so you can access it online. In short, a web hosting service is selling or renting a space that can be either cloud or dedicated server to launch and run websites on the web. Scripts, codes, images, and other content of the website are stored in the hosting server, so it can be accessed online by visitors. </p>
               <p>So, what exactly is a server? A server is a computer that hosting providers store websites in. Servers have certain storage and speed capacity to house websites. It connects online users from all around the world to your website. In other words, hosting servers make your website viewable all the time on the internet. Web hosting service providers are companies that provide the necessary hardware resources and servers, connection, and related services needed to launch the websites. They address the variety of hosting needs, from small websites to huge companies, by providing a few options of hosting plans. </p>
               <p>If you want to build an online presence, you'll need reliable web hosting. Today, there are hundreds of web hosts offering thousands of different web hosting services. Plans vary from free with few features to costly business-focused web hosting services. The plan you select will be based on how you intend to use your website and how much money you have set up for hosting.</p>
               <h2>Why do you need web hosting?</h2>
               <p>To store your website on the web and make it viewable to millions of users, you need a web hosting service. You have to store your website content including development code in the hosting server to make it up and running online. A web host, on the other hand, provides more than just web hosting services to business owners! Web hosting companies generally employ in-house experts to ensure that their client’s websites are up and running 24 hours a day, seven days a week. </p>
               <h2>Different types of web hosting</h2>
               <p>One of the first things you are going to decide is the type of hosting while launching your website. Common types of hosting are shared, VPS, reseller, WordPress, and dedicated hostings. They are distinguished by the sort of server technology used, the extent of management provided, and therefore the additional services available. </p>
               <h2>Shared web hosting</h2>
               <p>Shared hosting is a type of web hosting in which a single server is used to host many websites. For example, Site A, Site B, Site C, Site D, and Site E all share the same server. The benefit is that because the server costs are shared by several sites, shared web hosting is often relatively affordable. It's a low-cost web hosting service. Indeed, you may obtain a plan for less than $10 per month. You may consider the sites that share your server to be your housemates; there isn't much that separates you from them. Even if you close the bedroom door, they might still give you nightmares in the kitchen and bathroom. Because all of the sites share a single server's resources, large traffic spikes on Site A may influence the performance of the other sites. If the shared server crashes hard enough, another site may be able to take it down completely.</p>
               <h2>VPS web hosting</h2>
               <p>VPS hosting looks similar to shared hosting in that it allows multiple websites to share a single server, but that's about it. In terms of housing, VPS hosting is comparable to renting your apartment in a larger complex. You're considerably more isolated than you were in the previous roommate situation; it's still possible that a neighboring apartment would bother you, but it's far less likely. In terms of web hosting, Site A's traffic surge will have a far smaller influence on Site B and Site C. VPS hosting is more pricey than shared hosting, as you might imagine. Your monthly cost will be somewhere between $20 and $60.</p>
               <h2>Dedicated web hosting</h2>
               <p>On the other hand, dedicated hosting is both robust and costly. It's only for sites that necessitate a massive amount of server resources. A dedicated web hosting is a type of hosting in which the user rents an entire server space not shared with anyone else. Many web hosting companies also offer managed hosting in addition to dedicated hosting. In this case, the web host serves as your IT department, taking care of server maintenance and upkeep.</p>
               <h2>Reseller web hosting</h2>
               <p>Reseller hosting is a type of web hosting in which the account holder can use his or her allotted hard drive space and bandwidth to host websites for others. In this case, the ‘reseller' is the owner of the original hosting account. When the quantity of space purchased isn't needed and some of the allocated resources can be shared with another party, reseller hosting is a good option. While earning a recurring stream of money, you can share disk space, bandwidth, CPU, and other resources.</p>
               <h2>WordPress web hosting</h2>
               <p>WordPress hosting is intended for clients who want to use WordPress.org's popular content management system (CMS) to develop their websites. This free, open-source blogging and site-building platform can be used in a variety of ways. </p>
               <h2>How can you choose the best web hosting provider?</h2>
               <p>Many web providers provide limited functionality in their entry-level plans before expanding the capabilities in their higher-tier plans. If you need a site builder to develop your website, be sure the low-cost web host you choose includes one. Many of them demand that you pay for the website builder separately. Website builders usually don't cost much money, but if you can find a hosting provider with an extra builder bonus, you can save some of your money. When your website builder is integrated with your hosting service, users will have a smoother website experience. </p>
               <p>You should also look for a web host that offers customer service 24/7, if not by phone, then at least by chat. Forums, knowledge bases, and support tickets are all well and good, but sometimes you just need to talk to another person to get things straightened out.</p>
               <p>You must have an email if you want to have a web presence. It's a quick and easy way for potential clients and consumers to send you a message, a Word document, or other items. Fortunately, most web hosting services provide email as part of their hosting packages. Some web hosting providers allow you to create an unlimited number of email accounts, while others limit you to a certain number. You should, of course, desire unlimited email.</p>
               <p>The aforementioned qualities are useful for web hosting, but none of them compare to the importance of site uptime. Users will not be able to access your web content or services if your website is down. You have to be careful about uptime while choosing web hosting providers.</p>
               <p>Here are the top features to consider when you choose web hosting for your website:</p>
               <ul className='footer-lists'>
                   <li>Uptime, uptime and uptime!</li>
                   <li>Site speed</li>

                   <li>Migration features</li>
               </ul>
               <p>These are the major factors that you should consider when choosing a web hosting provider. Whatever your goal is with your website, you can achieve it with the best providers of these features.</p>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>It may be tempting to choose a web hosting provider fast and go on with your business, but taking your time is extremely preferable. You'll be able to find a long-term value provider this way.</p>
